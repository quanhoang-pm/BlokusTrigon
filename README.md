## Blokus trigon

Undoubtedly, Blokus trigon is the best board game I've ever known. Moreover, [Pentobi](https://pentobi.sourceforge.io/) is the best app that makes my dream comes true - playing Blokus trigon with my friends.

### How we organize a game together

Every two weeks, I share my laptop via TeamViewer so that all members can have access to the game on my laptop. An alternative option is to use Chrome Remote Control to provide access for _only one_ member (thanks T. for the suggestion).

### What this repository is

It contains all the games (in `games/` directory) we have played since I found out Pentobi. Games summary is located at the end of this file for some reason.

There will be a post in my blog where I present the beauty of Blokus trigon. The post is in progress, hope that it will be available soon.

### Why I upload these games

I believe that the games present what players think unconsciously. As a friend of mine rightly said,
> You are the pieces you've placed onto the board.

Therefore, it's a good chance for everyone to get to know more about me and other players through the games.

Of course, players identity will not be shown unless they allow me to do so. As you can see, there are some anonymous players, the only way to know who they are is ...

### Getting involved

Feel free to drop me a line via `quanhoang.pm@gmail.com` to let me know if you're interested in playing this board game (regularly) with us.

### Game summary

The summary records all players and their scores in all games we have played so far. The missing scores will be updated if I could find time. You can access scores in each game by yourself if you'd like.

Just a note that it is intuitive to score players by the number of triangles they've placed in a game. Therefore 110 points is the maximum score a player can get, and then he/she is called as a perfect player. Sometimes you could see a game with a 130-point player, it is just 20 more points rewarding to a perfect player, we don't count these 20 points in the summary.
